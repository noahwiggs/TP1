    fuel_volume (foat): volume of fuel
    oxidizer_mass (float): mass of oxidizer
    oxodizer_volume (float): volume of oxidizer

    --------------------
    Code takes propellant mass, uses the mixture ratio (weight) to find
    the mass of the fuel and oxidizer.
    Then find the volume of the fuel and oxidizer using its density
